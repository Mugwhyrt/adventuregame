GRAMMAR

Methods and constants for translating and parsing text. Constants are intended
to cover non-game specific words such as verbs and prepositions. More game
specific nouns and the result of a parsed sentence will be passed from props
in the game

General approach is inspired by a talk by Evan Wright for KansasFest 2017
'Making a Text Adventure Parser' - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=II3O1CJA-x8
